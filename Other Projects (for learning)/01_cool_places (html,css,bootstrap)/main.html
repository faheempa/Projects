                            degrees, the place feels like heaven as soon as you arrive; so much to
                            see and do in the region is another reason Kashmir has got to be high up

                        <p class="place-info">Meaning hill-top, Gangtok is perched at an elevation
                            of over 1500 meters and is fortunate to have cool weather even in the
                            summer months. This hill station in the North East region of India is
                            not only known for its awesome weather but also for a host of activities
                            and places to see. Nature’s abundance is evident here especially in the
                            summer with the forests coming alive making for some amazing trekking,
                            rafting and camping.</p>
