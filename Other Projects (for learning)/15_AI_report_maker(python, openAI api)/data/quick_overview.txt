This paper provides a review of different plant diseases and various advanced techniques for disease detection using image processing. The importance of agriculture in India is highlighted, with nearly 70% of the population depending on it for their livelihood. However, farmers often lack technical knowledge and struggle to identify diseases in plant leaves, leading to financial losses. The current reliance on pesticides can have negative effects on human health and the economy. Therefore, there is a need for fast and efficient techniques to detect plant diseases.

The paper discusses key issues and challenges in the field of disease analysis, such as obtaining high-quality images of plant leaves, dealing with large datasets, handling background data and noise, segmentation, classification, variation in leaf color, size, and texture, regular observation, and disease identification for different plant leaves. The importance of automation in disease detection is emphasized, as it can provide faster and more accurate results, help farmers take timely precautions, and reduce the use of pesticides.

The literature survey presents various types of plant diseases and the techniques used by researchers for disease detection, including computer vision technology, wavelet transform, clustering methods, artificial neural networks, deep learning methods, and image segmentation. The survey highlights the need for further research to develop more efficient and accurate techniques for disease identification. Automation is seen as crucial for the prevention and detection of plant diseases, benefiting both the agricultural sector and human well-being.
